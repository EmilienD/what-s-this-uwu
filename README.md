# What's this? UÏ‰U

Every object-oriented Javascript developer's favourite game, guessing what "this" is in the current context.

This is a simple game where you're shown a piece of code and have to guess the value of `this` when it is passed to the `whats` function.

    {
      "value": "global",
      "displayName": "global object",
      "isCorrect": true
    },
    {
      "value": "undefined"
    }
